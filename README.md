# Profit-Prediction-Using-R-D-Admin-Marketing-Spend
Analyzing the 50 Startups Dataset, this project explores the impact of R&amp;D, Administration, and Marketing costs on profitability. Using EDA and multiple linear regression, it identifies key factors influencing success and builds a profit prediction model. Insights help businesses optimize spending for better financial outcomes.

# Introduction:
* In today's competitive business environment, companies invest in various sectors such as Research & Development (R&D), Administration, and Marketing to maximize their profitability. Understanding the impact of these expenditures on business success is crucial for making informed financial decisions.

* This project analyzes the 50 Startups Dataset, which contains financial data of 50 startups across different states. The dataset includes key factors such as R&D Spend, Administration Costs, and Marketing Spend, along with the Profit generated by each startup. The goal is to explore relationships between these factors and build a predictive model to estimate Profit based on company expenditures.

* By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applying multiple linear regression, this study aims to identify which factors contribute the most to a startup’s profitability. The insights gained can help businesses optimize their spending strategies for better financial outcomes.

# Initial insights from inspection:
50 Rows and 5 features
4 are in float and 1 is in object
No null values
Problem identification: Multiple Linear Regression (Profit is a continuous variable and dataset has 4 independent and 1 dependent variable)

# Statistical Insights on Startup Investments and Profitability:
There is a wide range in R&D investments, with some startups spending nothing while others invest heavily. The high standard deviation indicates large variations in spending patterns, which may significantly impact profitability.
Unlike R&D, all startups have administration costs. The variation is moderate, indicating that most companies spend a similar amount on administrative expenses. However, this cost may not have a major impact on profit compared to R&D.
Some companies do not invest in marketing at all, while others allocate a huge budget. The high standard deviation suggests a large disparity in marketing strategies among startups. Companies with higher marketing spend might have higher visibility and revenue generation.
The profit distribution varies significantly across startups. The higher quartile (75%) shows that successful startups earn nearly $140,000 or more, while others make much lower profits.

# Business Impact & Recommendations
R&D Spend seems to be a key factor in profitability as some startups invest heavily, while others don’t. Startups investing more in R&D may have a competitive advantage.
Marketing investment shows high variation, indicating different strategies across companies. Higher marketing spending could lead to higher profits.
Administration costs remain relatively stable, suggesting they may not be a major profit-driving factor.
Startups with zero R&D or Marketing spend might struggle to generate high profits, based on observed trends.

# Insights from Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis examines the distribution of each variable separately to understand patterns, variations, and potential anomalies. Here are the insights based on the provided histograms:

Investing in R&D could be a major factor influencing profit, as companies spending more tend to see higher returns.
Since administration expenses are stable across startups, they may not have a significant impact on profit variation.
Since the distribution is even, state-wise location may not be a key factor affecting profit in this dataset.
Startups with higher marketing spend may experience better visibility and sales, which could directly impact profitability.
Startups with higher R&D and marketing investments tend to fall in the higher profit range, while those with zero R&D or marketing are in the lower range.
R&D and Marketing Spend have a strong impact on Profit, as seen from their distributions.
Administration costs are stable and may not be a major factor influencing profit.
Startups investing less in R&D and marketing tend to have lower profits, as indicated by the distribution.

# Bivariate Analysis Insights
R&D and Marketing investments are the key profit drivers, while administration costs remain uniform across states.
Administration expenses are evenly distributed across states, showing no regional influence.
Startups in Florida tend to be more profitable, indicating potential state-specific advantages.¶

# Heatmap Insights
A heatmap visualizes correlations between different numerical variables, helping identify strong or weak relationships.

R&D Spend and Profit were highly Correlated.
Marketing Spend and Profit were moderately correlated
Administration and profit were low correlated

# Insights
R&D Spend is the strongest predictor of profit.
Marketing Spend contributes to profit but is not the primary factor.
Administration expenses do not significantly impact profit.¶

# Dropping Administration reduces noise and enhances model performance.
# Scaling ensures features are on the same scale for better learning.

# All the vif values were less than 5, so no need of droping any column
vif 1-Not correlated
vif between 1 and 5 moderately correlated
vif more than 5 highly correlated

# No multicollinearity
# Model Selection & Training
Split data (Train-Test Split, 80-20 or 70-30)
Choose the model based on the problem
Train the model on the training dataset

# Final Conclusion & Insights:
# Model Performance: After testing multiple models (OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Decision Tree, XGBoost), Random Forest provided the best performance with a high R² score (Train: 0.99, Test: 0.96) and low RMSE ( Train: 0.031, Test: 0.061), indicating strong predictive power and minimal error.

# Feature Importance: R&D Spend had the highest impact on Profit, while Marketing Spend and State did not significantly contribute to the model, leading to their removal.

# Overfitting Analysis: Initial models showed signs of overfitting, but Random Forest balanced training and test accuracy effectively.

# Business Insight: Companies investing in R&D see a direct impact on profit, emphasizing the importance of innovation-driven spending.
# Random Forest is performing well and is more balanced.
